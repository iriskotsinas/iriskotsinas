It also investigates how noise can be applied to a plane to simulate snow as well as the simulation of falling snowflakes. For the terrain, Fractal Brownian Noise has been used. Instancing and billboards were used to simulate the snowflakes. For the tree, an L-system was created and used, as well as instancing for the branches and leaves to increase the performance.

The third report covers the topic of smooth surfaces and curves in computer graphics, and subdivision curves and surfaces are studied as an approximation thereof. The fourth report covers the implementation of implicit surfaces through a modeling framework called constructive solid geometry (CSG).

Games and AI are becoming more and more integrated to give the user a better experience and make games more fun to play. The aim of this project was to make a 2D platformer game, where the player has access to an artificially intelligent book that can classify doodle drawings using a trained neural network. This is a game that challenges your creativity and gives you a freedom to play the game however you want to play it and solve problems however you want to solve it. The project started with an attempt to build our own convolutional neural network that uses the ”Quick, Draw!" dataset.',description2:"Due to lack of access to powerful GPU/TPUs to train the large dataset, the number of classes was reduced to 50 instead of 345 and only contained animals. However, the final game uses a pre-trained model called DoodleNet to ensure fun and high quality gameplay. There are three ways to play this game: Draw your way through it (draw items and spawn as objects), say the object's name or write the object's name. Since we say \"A picture is worth a thousand words\", we made drawn objects more powerful. For weapons, they deal more damage, for vehicles they are faster and so on.",image:"",image2:"",slug:"/freeyourmind",report:A.a,simulation:"",sourcecode:"https://github.com/iriskotsinas/TDDD23_2D_game",video:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoJyfAJC10&t=3s"},{title:"Domesday - B.Sc. project Linköping University",description:"The project, created spring 2020, resulted in a multiplayer game for 50 to 100 players where each player connects to the game through a mobile phone device.

The game was developed using C++ and OpenGL, and communication was handled with node.js and websockets. The internal projection in the dome theater was handled by the tool SGCT that was provided by Linköping University.
